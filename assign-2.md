# ASSIGNMENT 2

See Gradescope for the due date.

## PART 1: Reaching Definitions

Implement the reaching definitions analysis as described in lecture.

As a reminder: the abstract domain is `ùí´(PP)` (the powerset of the set of
program points), where ‚ä• = `{}` and ‚ä§ = `PP` and ‚äî (i.e., join) is set union. A
program point is represented by `<basic block label>.{<index> | term}`, i.e.,
`bb1.2` is the instruction in basic block `bb1` with index 2 (starting from 0)
and `bb1.term` is the terminal instruction of `bb1`.

Remember that we still have the set `addr_taken` that acts similarly to the
integer-based analyses from assignment 1, but now it contains _all_
address-taken locals, _all_ globals, and also the fake variables representing
types allocated on the heap. Unlike assignment 1, there _can_ be globals in the
test programs. Globals can potentially have the same names as locals, so be sure
to distinguish between them during your analysis (e.g., you could represent
local variables with the string `<function name>.<id>` while globals would just
be named `<id>`).

The output of your analysis should be a map from program points (containing
uses) to sets of program points (containing the reaching defs of those uses):

```
<program point> -> { <program point>, ... }
...
```

Where the program points are listed in alphabetical order.

### Program points

Each program point we care about is of the form:

- `<bb>.<n>` for nth non-terminal instruction in bb (counting from 0).
- `<bb>.term` for the terminal instruction in bb.

### Type-based alias analysis

When accessing address-taken variables, you'd want to access only the ones of the relevant type.
If you store `addr_taken` as a map like `Type -> Set<Var>`, you are done.

#### Reachable types

Just like the last analysis, we care about when some types are reachable via pointer and field dereferences.
However, we have non-int variables, and we do type-based alias analysis.  So we want to calculate reachable types like before, but keep track of all such types rather than whether `int` is included. 

For type œÑ, let `reachable_types(œÑ)` be the set of types 'reachable' via pointer dereferences and/or struct field accesses from œÑ, excluding function types.
We don't include function types (e.g., `(int) -> int)`) because functions aren't allocated on the heap.

For example, in the snippet below:

>    struct foo {
>      f1: &bar
>      f2: &int
>    }
>    
>    struct bar {
>      f3: &(int) -> int
>      f4: &&int
>    }
>    
>    g: &foo
>    
>    // reachable_types(&foo) = { foo, &bar, bar, &&int, &int, int, &(int)->int }

#### Fake heap variables

Pointers may access only the heap, in which case we would miss some of the data flow.
To fix this, you need to create fake variables for each type of object that is accessed via a pointer (e.g., `fake_int`).

Here is how to create them:

Let `PTRS` = all pointer-typed globals, parameters, and locals of the function being analyzed, and `PTRS_œÑ` be the set of types of these variables.

For œÑ ‚àà reachable_types(PTRS_œÑ),
   create a fake variable to represent all heap-allocated objects of type `œÑ`,
   then insert each the fake variable (along with its type) into `addr_taken`.

## PART 2: Control Dependence

Implement the control dominance analysis and compute the dominance frontier for each basic block as described in lecture.

As a reminder, for the dominance analysis the abstract domain is `ùí´(BasicBlock)` (the powerset of the set of basic blocks), where ‚ä• = `BasicBlock` and ‚ä§ = `{}` and ‚äî (i.e., join) is set intersection.

The output of your analysis should be a map from basic blocks to sets of basic blocks (i.e., to the dominance frontier of each basic block):

```
<bb> -> { <bb>, ... }
...
```

Where the basic blocks are listed in alphabetical order.

## REFERENCE SOLUTIONS

I have placed executables of my own solutions to these analyses on vlabs in
`~memre/cs686/{reaching_defs, control}`. You can use these reference solutions
to test your analyses before submitting. If you have any questions about the
output format, you can answer them using these reference solutions as well;
these are the solutions that Gradescope will use to test your submissions. My
solutions only take two arguments (as opposed to the three that your solutions
should take, described below): the file containing the LIR program and the name
of the function to analyze.

## SUBMITTING TO GRADESCOPE

Your submission must meet the following requirements:

- There must be a `build-analyses.sh` bash script that does whatever is needed
  to build or setup both analyses (e.g., compile the code if necessary). If
  nothing is necessary the script must still exist, it can just to nothing.

- There must be `run-rdef.sh` and `run-control.sh` bash scripts that each take
  three command-line arguments: the first is a file containing the LIR program
  to analyze, the second is a file containing the same program in JSON format,
  and the third is the name of the function to analyze. You can use whichever
  program format you wish and ignore the other. Each script must print the
  result of the respective analysis to standard out.

- If your solution contains sub-directories then the entire submission must be
  given as a zip file (this is required by Gradescope for submissions that
  contain a directory structure). The scripts should all be at the root
  directory of the solution.

- The submitted files are not allowed to contain any binaries, and your
  solutions are not allowed to use the network. Your build scripts _are_ allowed
  to use the network if they need to install anything, but be wary of how much
  time they take (build time is part of the Gradescope timeout).

If you want to submit one analysis before you've implemented the other that's
fine, but you still need all the scripts I mentioned (otherwise the grader will
barf). The script for the missing analysis can just do nothing.

## GRADING

Here's how the grading will be broken down so that you can focus your work accordingly. There are two parts to the assignment (reaching defs and control dependence); reaching defs is worth 2 points and control dependence is worth 1 point.

The point breakdown for reaching definitions is (let P = pointers, S = structs, G = globals, F = function calls):

- Programs without PSGF: 0.6

- Programs without PSG, with F: 0.2

- Programs without PS, with GF: 0.3

- Programs without GF, with PS: 0.3

- Programs without F, with PSG: 0.3

- Programs with PSGF: 0.3

The point breakdown for control dependence is:

- Any valid program: 1

Each of these categories will have a test suite of LIR programs that will be
used to test your submission on that category for the given analysis. You must
get all tests in a given test suite correct in order to receive points for the
corresponding category. You are encouraged to focus on one category at a time
and get it fully correct before moving on to the next. Remember that you can
also create your own test programs and use my solution on vlabs to see what my
solution for that program would be.
